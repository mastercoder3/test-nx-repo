### Fresh start?

In case you're serving the application locally, in that case,
you can run these in sequence

Run to install dependencies

```
npm install
```

In case of any dependency error, use the following command

```
npm install --force
```

This will make sure all the dependencies are installed since there could be versioning issues

#### Starting Server

You can start the `development` server by running

```
npm run start
```

After that run

```
npm run server
```
